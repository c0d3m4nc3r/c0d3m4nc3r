# Hi, I'm c0d3m4nc3r 👋

I'm Python/C/C++ Developer with 6 Years of Experience

My programming journey started back in 2019 when I began learning Python on my old Android phone (because my laptop was broken at the time). I learned crazy fast — this language just clicked for me.

I landed my first gig in spring 2022 after meeting some guy in a chat. He asked me to code a simple Telegram bot and paid me a whopping 150 UAH (~$5 at the time). I was hyped — my first programming money! Later, we worked on more projects together, even a full-blown movie/TV show streaming site.

That same summer, I got into game engines and wrote my first OpenGL project in C — a simple 3D environment with a chessboard-patterned floor where you could "walk around" and look with the mouse. The whole thing was just 200 lines of code. Technically, it was my first C project, though I’d already written CS: Source cheats in C++ before that. xdd

Later, I tried writing engines in Python (my comfort zone), but… yeah, it’s Python, so nothing serious came out of it lol. Eventually, I realized C++ was the way to go. At first, the weird syntax and lack of Python’s conveniences drove me nuts, but I fell in love with it. Now, Python code makes my head spin.

Now, I’m deep into game engines — my dream is to build a full-fledged one from scratch.

Current life goal: Make a masterpiece game, earn gazillions of dollars, then "retire" to a cabin in the woods (jk... unless?).

But for now, I’m broke, jobless, leeching off my parents, because apparently, nobody cares about my experience without a degree. Sadge.
